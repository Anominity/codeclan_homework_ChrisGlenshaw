Question 1


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(CodeClanData)
```


```{r}
drinks_content
```

```{r}
dim(drinks_content)
```

```{r}
names(drinks_content)
```

```{r}
glimpse(drinks_content)
```

Question 2
```{r}
calorie_content <- select(drinks_content, "Beverage_category", "Beverage", "Beverage_prep", "Calories")

calorie_content

#Unable to get drop.na function to be recognised
#drop.na(calorie_content)

```

Question 3

```{r}
calorie_difference <- mutate(calorie_content,
       calorie_dif = Calories - 135)

calorie_difference
```

Question 4

```{r}
category_grouped <- group_by(drinks_content, 
           Beverage_category)

category_grouped

summarise(category_grouped, mean(Calories))


```

Standard Coffee drinks have by far the fewest calories, followed by Shaken Iced Beverages. Classic Frappuccino Blended Coffee & Smoothies have a very large number of calories.

Question 5

```{r}
prep_grouped <- group_by(drinks_content, 
                         Beverage_prep)

prep_grouped

prep_group_mean_calories <- summarise(prep_grouped, 
          mean(Calories))

prep_group_mean_calories
```

Question 6

```{r}
average_calories <- pull(summarise(drinks_content, mean(Calories)))

average_calories

filter(prep_group_mean_calories, 
       ("mean(Calories)" >= average_calories) == TRUE)

```
Not sure why this won't work

Question 7

Solo Espresso
